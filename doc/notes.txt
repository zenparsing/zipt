== File Attributes ==

Operating system file attributes are stored in the "attr" property of the 
entry header.  This value only has meaning with respect to the originating
file system.  The originating file system can be found in the lower byte
of the "versionMadeBy" field in the entry header.

TODO: How do we get the proper attributes on different systems?

== Zip64 ==

Basically, the size and offset fields defined in the ZIP specification are
all 4-byte (32-bit) integers with a maximum value of 4294967295.  If the value
to be stored is larger, then a 0xffffffff value will be stored in it's place
and the correct value will be stored in a zip64 extension data structure.
For file headers, that data is located in the "extra" field.  We'll need to be
able to parse those extra fields.  For values in the end-of-central-directory,
the correct values will be stored in a special zip64 end-of-central-directory
structure which preceeds the end-of-central-directory proper.

== Disk Spanning ==

This going to be such a rarely used feature nowadays.  In fact, I think we can
safely not support it.

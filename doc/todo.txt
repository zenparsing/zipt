== TODO ==

- Minimize memory usage.  We are using way more memory than is needed.  What
  portion of the code is generating unbounded memory allocations?

- Should we perform checks on file offsets, etc., before attempting reads?
  Should we attempt to work with an invalid zip file or just bork (as now)?
  
- Case sensitivity.  Should we allow or disallow?  Right now we allow.

- What happens if a required folder was not included in the central
  directory?  Do we go ahead and create it, or do we fail?

- There should be a set of options that will control things like whether
  files are overwritten (or just newer ones).  Also buffer sizes.

- Zip64 support?

- A mechanism for reading the extra header bytes?  Support for Zip64 would
  necessitate this.

- Support for encrypted archives?  Probably not at this time.

- Adding or removing files from an existing (open) archive.  This will involve
  copying the compressed data instead of generating it.

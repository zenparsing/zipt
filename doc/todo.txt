== TODO ==

- Getting EMFILE errors when doing massive work.  This means that node is
  opening up too many files at one time.  It might require that we respond
  to EMFILE errors by waiting and retrying the operation.  Have a look at
  graceful-fs.

- Formalized testing - don't make any changes to code until we have a more
  formalized testing system.

- Should we perform checks on file offsets, etc., before attempting reads?
  Should we attempt to work with an invalid zip file or just bork (as now)?

- It would be a good idea to analyze memory usage.

- Case sensitivity.  Should we allow or disallow?  Right now we allow.

- What happens if a required folder was not included in the central
  directory?  Do we go ahead and create it, or do we fail?

- There should be a set of options that will control things like whether
  files are overwritten (or just newer ones).  Also buffer sizes.

- Zip64 support?

- A mechanism for reading the extra header bytes?  Support for Zip64 would
  necessitate this.

- Support for encrypted archives?  Probably not at this time.

- Adding or removing files from an existing (open) archive.  This will involve
  copying the compressed data instead of generating it.

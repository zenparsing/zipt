== TODO ==

- What name should we use when writing extended attributes?

- Since we are using FS.stat (i.e. following links), we could end up with
  infinite recursion.  We'll need to account for this.
  
- Problem with generic interface:  we need to have a general "type" field,
  rather than checking isDirectory.  But that still presents issues for
  the generic ArchiveReader interface.  How do we know what to do with
  entries that are neither files nor directories?  We are currently using
  isDirectory/isFile, which I'm not satisfied with.

- Provide filter for nextEntry() API.

- Zip: throw on invalid checksum.

- Pipe API and signature review.  There should be an easier way to do the common
  task.

- Should we be locking our ad hoc streams in ZipEntry and TarEntry?

- Propagation of options for things like pipe/memory settings, compression
  settings, overwrite settings, etc.  Also allow a filter function which
  determines whether or not to extract/compress a file.

- Case sensitivity.  Should we allow or disallow?  Right now we allow.

- Zip64 support?

- A mechanism for reading the extra zip header bytes?  Support for Zip64 would
  necessitate this.

- Adding or removing files from an existing (open) archive.  This will involve
  copying the compressed data instead of generating it.

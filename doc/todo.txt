== TODO ==

- We desperately need a formalized test suite.  What's the easiest way to create one?

- What name should we use when writing extended attributes?  What does node-tar use?

- Since we are using FS.stat (i.e. following links), we could end up with
  infinite recursion.  We'll need to account for this.

- Provide filter for nextEntry() API.

- Pipe API and signature review.  There should be an easier way to do the common
  task.

- Should we be locking our ad hoc streams in ZipEntry and TarEntry?

- Propagation of options for things like pipe/memory settings, compression
  settings, overwrite settings, etc.

- Zip: case sensitivity.  Should we allow or disallow?  Right now we allow.

- Zip64 support?

- A mechanism for reading the extra zip header bytes?  Support for Zip64 would
  necessitate this.

- API for appending to an archive.  Low priority.

- API or options for monitoring progress?
